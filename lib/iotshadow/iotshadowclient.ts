     *
     * subscribeToUpdateNamedShadowAccepted may be called while the device is offline, though the async
     * operation cannot complete successfully until the connection resumes.
     *
     * Once subscribed, `messageHandler` is invoked each time a message matching
     * the `topic` is received. It is possible for such messages to arrive before
     * the SUBACK is received.

     *
     * @param request Subscription request configuration
     * @param qos Maximum requested QoS that server may use when sending messages to the client.
     *            The server may grant a lower QoS in the SUBACK
     * @param messageHandler Callback invoked when message or error is received from the server.
     * @returns Promise which returns a `mqtt.MqttSubscribeRequest` which will contain the
     *          result of the SUBSCRIBE. The Promise resolves when a SUBACK is returned
     *          from the server or is rejected when an exception occurs.
