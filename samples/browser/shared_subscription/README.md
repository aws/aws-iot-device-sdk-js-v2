# Browser: MQTT5 PubSub

[**Return to main sample list**](../../README.md)

This sample uses the
[Message Broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-message-broker.html)
for AWS IoT to send and receive messages over an MQTT5 connection using a shared subscription.

MQTT5 introduces additional features and enhancements that improve the development experience with MQTT. You can read more about MQTT5 in the Javascript V2 SDK by checking out the [MQTT5 user guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-nodejs/blob/main/MQTT5-UserGuide.md).

Note: MQTT5 support is currently in **developer preview**. We encourage feedback at all times, but feedback during the preview window is especially valuable in shaping the final product. During the preview period we may make backwards-incompatible changes to the public API, but in general, this is something we will try our best to avoid.

[Shared Subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html#mqtt5-shared-subscription) allow IoT devices to connect to a group where messages sent to a topic are then relayed to the group in a round-robin-like fashion. This is useful for distributing message load across multiple subscribing MQTT5 clients automatically. This is helpful for load balancing when you have many messages that need to be processed.

Shared Subscriptions rely on a group name/identifier, which tells the MQTT5 broker/server which IoT devices to treat as a group for message distribution. This is done when subscribing by formatting the subscription topic like the following: `$share/<ShareName>/<TopicFilter>`.
* `$share`: Tells the MQTT5 broker/server that the device is subscribing to a Shared Subscription.
* `<ShareName>`: Tells the MQTT5 broker/server which group to add this Shared Subscription to. Messages published to a matching topic will be distributed round-robin amongst the group.
* `<TopicFilter>`: The topic that the Shared Subscription is for. Messages published to this topic will be processed in a round-robin fashion. For example, `test/topic`.

Shared Subscriptions use a round-robbin like method of distributing messages for the subscribed clients. For example, say you have three MQTT5 clients all subscribed to the same Shared Subscription group and topic. If five messages are sent to the Shared Subscription topic, the messages will likely be delivered in the following order:
* Message 1 -> Client one
* Message 2 -> Client two
* Message 3 -> Client three
* Message 4 -> Client one
* Message 5 -> Client two
* etc...

Your IoT Core Thing's [Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html) must provide privileges for this sample to connect, subscribe, publish, and receive. Below is a sample policy that can be used on your IoT Core Thing that will allow this sample to run as intended.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topic/test/topic",
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topic/$share/*/test/topic"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topicfilter/test/topic",
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topicfilter/$share/*/test/topic"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:client/test-*"

    }

Replace with the following with the data from your AWS account:
* `<region>`: The AWS IoT Core region where you created your AWS IoT Core thing you wish to use with this sample. For example `us-east-1`.
* `<account>`: Your AWS IoT Core account ID. This is the set of numbers in the top right next to your AWS account name when using the AWS IoT Core website.

Note that in a real application, you may want to avoid the use of wildcards in your ClientID and shared subscription group names/identifiers. Wildcards should only be used selectively. Please follow best practices when working with AWS on production applications using the SDK. Also, for the purposes of this sample, please make sure your policy allows a client ID of `test-*` to connect or use `--client_id <client ID here>` to send the client ID your policy supports.

## How to run

To run this sample you need to have a Cognito identity pool setup that can be used for making IoT connections. To see how to setup a Cognito identity pool, please refer to this page on the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/tutorial-create-identity-pool.html).

Once you have a Cognito identity pool, you need to fill in the credentials in the `browser/shared_subscription/settings.js` file with your AWS endpoint, AWS region, and Cognito identity pool. You can fill in the other settings if you want/need as well. Run `npm install` in the `browser/shared_subscription` folder to build the sample. open `browser/shared_subscription/index.html` to run the sample in your browser!

If configured correctly, it should make three MQTT5 clients, two of them will subscribe to a shared topic, and then the remaining MQTT5 client will make a number of publishes. Finally, once the set number of publishes have been met, the sample will unsubscribe the two MQTT5 clients and disconnect all of the MQTT5 clients.
