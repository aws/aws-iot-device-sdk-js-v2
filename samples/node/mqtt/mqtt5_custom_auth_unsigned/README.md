## Introduction
This sample uses the
[Message Broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-message-broker.html)
for AWS IoT to send and receive messages through an MQTT connection using MQTT5 with a custom authorizer for authentication.

You can read more about MQTT5 for the JavaScript IoT Device SDK V2 in the [MQTT5 user guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-nodejs/blob/main/MQTT5-UserGuide.md).

## Requirements

You will need to setup your Custom Authorizer so the Lambda function returns a policy document. See [this page on the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/config-custom-auth.html) for more details and example return result. You can customize this lambda function as needed for your application to provide your own security measures based on the needs of your application.

The policy [Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html) provided by your Custom Authorizer Lambda must provide iot connect, subscribe, publish, and receive privileges for this sample to run successfully.

Below is a sample policy that provides the necessary privileges.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topic/test/topic"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topicfilter/test/topic"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:client/mqtt5-sample-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

Replace with the following with the data from your AWS account:
* `<region>`: The AWS IoT Core region where you created your AWS IoT Core thing you wish to use with this sample. For example `us-east-1`.
* `<account>`: Your AWS IoT Core account ID. This is the set of numbers in the top right next to your AWS account name when using the AWS IoT Core website.

Note that in a real application, you may want to avoid the use of wildcards in your ClientID or use them selectively. Please follow best practices when working with AWS on production applications using the SDK. Also, for the purposes of this sample, please make sure your policy allows a client ID of `mqtt5-sample-*` to connect or use `--client_id <client ID here>` to send the client ID your policy supports.

## How to run

To Run this sample from the `samples/node/mqtt/mqtt5_custom_auth_unsigned` folder, use the following command:

```sh
npm install
node index.js \
  --endpoint <AWS IoT endpoint> \
  --authorizer_name <custom authorizer name> \
  --auth_username <username> \
  --auth_password <password>
```
If you would like to see what optional arguments are available, use the `--help` argument:
``` sh
node index.js --help
```

will result in the following output:
```
Options:
      --version          Show version number                           [boolean]
  -e, --endpoint         IoT endpoint hostname               [string] [required]
  -a, --authorizer_name  The name of the custom authorizer to connect to invoke
                                                             [string] [required]
  -u, --auth_username    The name to send when connecting through the custom
                         authorizer                          [string] [required]
  -p, --auth_password    The password to send when connecting through a custom
                         authorizer                          [string] [required]
  -C, --client_id        Client ID   [string] [default: "mqtt5-sample-886c301b"]
  -t, --topic            Topic                  [string] [default: "test/topic"]
  -m, --message          Message payload
                                   [string] [default: "Hello from mqtt5 sample"]
  -n, --count            Messages to publish (0 = infinite)[number] [default: 5]
      --help             Show help                                     [boolean]
```

The sample will not run without the required arguments and will notify you of missing arguments.

## Additional Information
Additional help with the MQTT5 Client can be found in the [MQTT5 Userguide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-nodejs/blob/main/MQTT5-UserGuide.md). This guide will provide more details on MQTT5 operations, lifecycle events, connection methods, and other useful information.
