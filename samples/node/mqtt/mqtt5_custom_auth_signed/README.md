## Introduction

You will need to setup your Custom Authorizer so the Lambda function returns a policy document. See [this page on the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/config-custom-auth.html) for more details and example return result. You can customize this lambda function as needed for your application to provide your own security measures based on the needs of your application.

The policy [Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html) provided by your Custom Authorizer Lambda must provide iot connect, subscribe, publish, and receive privileges for this sample to run successfully.

Below is a sample policy that provides the necessary privileges.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topic/test/topic"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topicfilter/test/topic"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:client/mqtt5-sample-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

Replace with the following with the data from your AWS account:
* `<region>`: The AWS IoT Core region where you created your AWS IoT Core thing you wish to use with this sample. For example `us-east-1`.
* `<account>`: Your AWS IoT Core account ID. This is the set of numbers in the top right next to your AWS account name when using the AWS IoT Core website.

Note that in a real application, you may want to avoid the use of wildcards in your ClientID or use them selectively. Please follow best practices when working with AWS on production applications using the SDK. Also, for the purposes of this sample, please make sure your policy allows a client ID of `mqtt5-sample-*` to connect or use `--client_id <client ID here>` to send the client ID your policy supports.

Your custom authorizer must be configured to accept token-based authentication with signature validation.

## How to run

To Run this sample from the `samples/node/mqtt/mqtt5_custom_auth_signed` folder, use the following command:

```sh
npm install
node index.js \
  --endpoint <AWS IoT endpoint> \
  --authorizer_name <custom authorizer name> \
  --auth_signature <signature> \
  --auth_token_key_name <token key name> \
  --auth_token_key_value <token key value>
```
If you would like to see what optional arguments are available, use the `--help` argument:
``` sh
node index.js --help
```

will result in the following output:
```
