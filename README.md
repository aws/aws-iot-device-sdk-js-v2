# AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript v2
This document provides information about the AWS IoT device SDK for Javascript V2.

If you have any issues or feature requests, please file an issue or pull request.

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt),
[aws-c-http](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http),
[aws-c-cal](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-cal) ...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to JS by the [awscrt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-nodejs) package.

* `libssl-dev` or `openssl-dev` (on Linux)

[Step-by-step instructions](./documents/PREREQUISITES.md)

### Build SDK in existing project with NPM
``` sh
# Navigate to the Javascript project you want to add the
# Javascript V2 SDK to.
cd <your javascript project here>
# Install the V2 SDK.
npm install aws-iot-device-sdk-v2
# Now you can use the Javascript V2 SDK in your project.
```

### Build the V2 SDK from source

``` sh
# Create a workspace directory to hold all the SDK files.
mkdir sdk-workspace
cd sdk-workspace
# Clone the repository to access the samples.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2.git
# Ensure all submodules are properly updated.
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2
git submodule update --init --recursive
# Install the SDK.
npm install
# Then you can run the samples following the instructions in the samples README.
```

### Build the V2 SDK and CRT from source

``` sh
# Create a workspace directory to hold all the SDK files.
mkdir sdk-workspace
cd sdk-workspace
# Clone the CRT repository.
#     (Use the latest version of the CRT here instead of "v1.12.4").
git clone --branch v1.12.4 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-nodejs.git
# Ensure all submodules are properly updated.
cd aws-crt-nodejs
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
# Clone the SDK repository.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2.git
# Ensure all submodules are properly updated.
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2
git submodule update --init --recursive
# Install the CRT.
npm install ../aws-crt-nodejs
# Install the SDK.
npm install
# Then you can run the samples following the instructions in the samples README.
```
