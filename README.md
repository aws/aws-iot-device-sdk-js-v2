This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt),
[aws-c-http](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http),
[aws-c-cal](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-cal) ...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to JS by the [awscrt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-nodejs) package.
